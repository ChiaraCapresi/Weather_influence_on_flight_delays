# Business Question 1: Does the weather effectively influence the flights departure delays?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
```




```{r}
flights_weather <- read_csv(here::here("cleaned_data/flights_weather.csv"))
tight_flights_weather <- read_csv(here::here("cleaned_data/tight_flights_weather.csv"))
```



```{r}
skimr::skim(tight_flights_weather)
```




```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>% 
  summarise(cor(dep_delay, arr_delay))
```

**ASSUMPTION 2**
First of all we notice that the arrival delays are strongly positive correlated with the departure delay. Since also the weather dataset refers only to the departure airports and for now I decided to ignore the arrival delays, I could consider to leave the `flights_weather` dataset as it is and to consider a smoller dataset to possibly join with the other that doesn't contains the departure delays.



```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  select(dep_delay, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, visib) %>% 
  ggcorr(label = TRUE)
```


At a first sight, looking at the correlation indexes, it seems that there is not so much interaction between `dep_delays` and `weather` conditions.

I also notice that there is a very strong correlation between `wind speed` and `wind gust speed` for this reason, I could consider to delete one of the two since their relationship is so strong.



```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  select(wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, visib, dep_delay) %>% 
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```

It seems interesting to analyse the relationship that `dep_delays` has with `wind_speed` and `visibility`.



```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wind_speed, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_point()
```



# Wind Speed

 
 
```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>%
  group_by(month, wind_speed_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = month, y = mean_dep_delay, fill = wind_speed_group)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  #geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n months",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different wind speed conditions\n"
  )+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 12)
```

Generally speaking the wind speed is not regular during the year even if, having a look of the below plot, it seems that the departure delays seems to be more uniformly distributed with a few exceptions during winter. This would suggest that there is not a great relationship between departure delays and wind speed, as we already noticed looking at the correlation coefficients.

However, looking with more attention at the above plot, we can notice that, at least, month by month it seems that the length of the delays increase when the wind speed is particularly high (look at May) even if even this proportion doesn't seems to be regular. 


```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wind_speed_group, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_boxplot()
```







```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>%
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = month, y = mean_dep_delay)+
  geom_col(fill = "9900FF")+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 12)+
  labs(
    x = "\nmonths",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays per month in 2017\n"
  )+
  theme_light()
```


```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = as.numeric(wind_speed), y = dep_delay)+
  geom_point()
```


Looking at this plot, it seems that the wind speed influence more the number of delays than their length at least when it is less than 25, this could suggest that for very critical wind speed conditions the planes are equipped to deal with such intence wind!? by this is just an assumption.


## Visib





```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  group_by(month, visib_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = month, y = mean_dep_delay, fill = visib_group)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  #geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n months",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different wind speed conditions\n"
  )+
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 12)
```

It seems that the visibility can be considered as a better parameter for measuring the departure delays than the wind speed.


However, since we saw that the correlation coefficient is still very low, we can deduce that even if its true that in mean less visibility is in some way proportional to the length of delays it cannot be considered as a significant parameter.



```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = visib_group, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_boxplot()
```


```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  distinct(wind_dir)
```



```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wind_dir, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_point()
```


I don't find from this plot a particular incidence of `wind_dir` with the `dep_delay`.

## Business Question 2: Are there any other factors that together with `wind speed` and `visibility` influence the length of flights delays expecially at Newark Airport? 






### Airlines

```{r}
airlines <- read_csv("../raw_data/airlines.csv") %>% 
  rename("airline" = "name")
```


```{r}
airlines_weather_imp <- left_join(tight_flights_weather, airlines, "carrier")
airlines_weather_imp
```

```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  summarise(across(.col = everything(), .fns = ~sum(is.na(.x))))
```

```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  distinct(carrier)
```

First of all let's have a look to see if there is a particular difference in terms of flights delays length among the different airlines.

```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  group_by(airline) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = airline, y = mean_dep_delay)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge", fill = "mediumorchid1")+
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n Airlines",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different airlines\n"
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) 
```

It seems that `ExpressJet Airlines` and `SkyWest Airlines` register the longest delays.

Let's have a look now at how this is related to the weather.

```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  group_by(airline, wind_speed_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = airline, y = mean_dep_delay, fill = wind_speed_group)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n Airlines",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different wind speed conditions and airlines\n"
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) 
```

Comparing these two last plots I can conclude that on the one hand, very fast winds can be related to longer delays, but it still doesn't seem to be the major impact factor. It seems that the impact that wind speed can have on the length of the delays depends, in addition to the period of the year, also from an airline to the other.
Let's have a look, for example, at the `Alaska Airlines`. In mean it register the shortest delays with respect to the other companies, even if it seems that the length of delays for this company is strongly related to the wind speed.
An opposite conclusion instead can be drawn, for example, for the `SkyWest Airlines` which seems to register longer delays which doesn't seems to be very much related to the wind speed. 


```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  group_by(airline, visib_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = airline, y = mean_dep_delay, fill = visib_group)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n Airlines",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different visibility conditions and airline\n"
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) 
```


It doesn't seem to me that this plot add anything of particular interest to the conclusions we already drawn about visibility dependence of the length of flights delays. It seems that a few companies maybe are less affected by visibility, but generally speaking the trend seems more or less to be the same that we noticed in the general plot.


## Airports


```{r}
airports_weather_imp <- read_csv("../cleaned_data/airports_weather_imp.csv")
```


```{r}
airports_weather_imp
```




```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  group_by(origin) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = origin, y = mean_dep_delay)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge", fill = "lightsalmon")+
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n Departure Airports",
    y = "Departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different departure airports\n"
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) 
```

It doesn't seems that airports doesn't have a particular incidence with the length of delays, but let's have a look of the different weather conditions.


```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  group_by(origin, wind_speed_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = origin, y = mean_dep_delay, fill = wind_speed_group)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n Airlines",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different wind speed conditions and airports\n"
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) 
```

It seems that a very intense wind speed influence in some ways the length of flights delays in the airports of `La Guardia`, so as in `Newark Liberty`, which is the one we are more interested in. Less impact instead seems to have at `JFK`. However, just winds with a speed greater than 26 mph seems to have any kind of relationship, there is no significant patterns to find out for winds with a less intense speed than 26.

```{r}
airports_weather_imp %>% 
  distinct(airport, origin)
```




```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  group_by(origin, airline, wind_speed_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = origin, y = mean_dep_delay, fill = wind_speed_group)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n Airlines",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different wind speed conditions and airports\n"
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))+
  facet_wrap(~airline)
```


Very few companies seems to have a certain relationship between very intense wind speed and length of delays and only in specific airports.






```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  group_by(origin, visib_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = origin, y = mean_dep_delay, fill = visib_group)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n Airlines",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different visibility conditions and airports\n"
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))
```

A very law visibility seems to have a certain impact on delays' length at `La Guardia`, but not particularly on the other two.



```{r}
airlines_weather_imp %>% 
  group_by(origin, airline, visib_group) %>% 
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = origin, y = mean_dep_delay, fill = visib_group)+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  theme_light()+
  labs(
    x = "\n Airlines",
    y = "departure delays mean (in mins)\n",
    title = "\nDeparture delays depending on different visibility conditions, airports and airlines\n"
  )+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))+
  facet_wrap(~airline)
```


Just `SkyWest Airlines` at `Nework Liberty International Airport` seems to have a strong relation between delays' length and very low visibility.
