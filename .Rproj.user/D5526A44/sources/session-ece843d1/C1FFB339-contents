# Business Question 1: Does the weather effectively influence the flights departure delays and which weather condition impact mostly?

In this first file I am going to concentrate on the first important business question which ask whether or not effectively weather does influence the length of flights delays.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
```


```{r}
flights_weather <- read_csv(here::here("cleaned_data/flights_weather.csv"))
```


```{r}
skimr::skim(flights_weather)
```

At first I need to specify that I decide to concentrate on the impact of weather on the length of delays and not on their number.
This is because, the length of delays seems to me much more interesting, if I am in aim of comparing the delays to the weather conditions.



```{r}
flights_weather %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>% 
  summarise(cor(dep_delay, arr_delay))
```

**ASSUMPTION**
First of all I notice that the arrival delays are strongly positive correlated with the departure delay. Since also the weather dataset refers only to the departure airports and for now I decided to ignore the arrival delays, I could consider to leave the `flights_weather` dataset as it is and to consider a smaller dataset to possibly join with the other that doesn't contains the departure delays.

```{r}
flights_weather
```



## Correlation coefficients

At first I will have a look of the correlation coefficients between the `dep_delay` and the weather features I selected.


```{r}
flights_weather %>% 
  select(dep_delay, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, visib) %>% 
  ggcorr(label = TRUE)
```


At a first sight, looking at the correlation indexes, it seems that there is not so much interaction between `dep_delays` and `weather` conditions. However, since the dataset is really big, I will check these correlations in a more accurate way.

I also notice that there is a very strong correlation between `wind speed` and `wind gust speed` for this reason, I could consider to delete one of the two since their relationship is so strong.




```{r}
flights_weather %>% 
  select(wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, visib, dep_delay) %>% 
  ggpairs(progress = FALSE)
```



Here the correlation coefficients seems, even if still quite low, to give a more precise idea of the correlations. Foe example, looking at them, it seems interesting to analyse the relationship that `dep_delays` has with `wind_dir`, `wind_speed` and `visibility`.


Let's have a more accurate view of how these three features are related with the 'departure delays'.

# Wind Speed

```{r}
flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wind_speed, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_point()
```

From this plot it seems that the `wind_speed` is more related maybe to the number of delays than to their length, but I am not actually interested in that, since I decided to concentrate on their length.


```{r}
model_speed_1 <- lm(dep_delay ~ wind_speed, flights_weather)
summary(model_speed_1)
```

Looking at the summary it seems that the `wind_speed` doesn't influence so much the `dep_delay` since it increase the delays only of a 0.11 coefficient. Let's have a look of what happens with the discrete grouping of the 'wind direction'.



```{r}
model_speed_2 <- lm(dep_delay ~ wind_speed_group, flights_weather)
summary(model_speed_2)
```

From this model we can realise that splitting the wind_speed into groups can be useful for having a more accurate idea of how wind speed influence the departure delays. It would be also better to split it into simply two categories which seems to be more representative: '0 - 25' mph and 'over 26' mph. I will do all the grouping modifications in the `tight_flights_weather` dataset.



```{r}
tight_flights_weather <- read_csv(here::here("cleaned_data/tight_flights_weather.csv"))
```


```{r}
model_speed_3 <- lm(dep_delay ~ wind_speed_group, tight_flights_weather)
summary(model_speed_3)
```
This grouping seems to be much more representative!


```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wind_speed_group, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

# wind_dir

```{r}
flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wind_dir, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_point()
```







```{r}
model_dir_1 <- lm(dep_delay ~ wind_dir, flights_weather)
summary(model_dir_1)
```

Again, it doesn't seems that, in general, `wind_dir` have significant impact on the delays, but let's have a look of what happen splitting it into groups.



```{r}
model_dir_2 <- lm(dep_delay ~ wind_dir_group, flights_weather)
summary(model_dir_2)
```

Also in this case, it seems that there would be a better way of slitting `wind_dir`: `less than 200` and `great than 200`.


```{r}
model_dir_3 <- lm(dep_delay ~ wind_dir_group, tight_flights_weather)
summary(model_dir_3)
```
It seems that, generally speaking, wind directions greater than 200 has a certain influence on the delays, much more than directions less than 200.


```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = wind_dir_group, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

# visib



```{r}
flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = visib, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_point()
```


```{r}
model_visib_1 <- lm(dep_delay ~ visib, flights_weather)
summary(model_visib_1)
```

Same result as before. It doesn't seem that, generally speaking, the visibility influence a lot flights delays. Let's have a look of the grouped visibility.






```{r}
model_visib_2 <- lm(dep_delay ~ visib_group, flights_weather)
summary(model_visib_2)
```


Also in this case it would be better to group visibility in a different way: `less than 5` and `greater than 5`.



```{r}
model_visib_1 <- lm(dep_delay ~ visib_group, tight_flights_weather)
summary(model_visib_1)
```



```{r}
tight_flights_weather %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x = visib_group, y = dep_delay)+
  geom_boxplot()
```
